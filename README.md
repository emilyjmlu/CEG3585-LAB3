To run the project, first run `javac *.java` in your terminal to compile all of the Java files. Ensure that this command is executed where the source code is.

Then, to start the Server, run `java Server` in one terminal. Run `java Client` in another terminal to start the client. A UI dialog will show up asking for client input.
